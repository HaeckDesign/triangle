# Triangle Ghost Theme #

The Triangle Ghost theme is built as a solid foundation for any Ghost project. This theme can serve as a starting point for advanced web developers, while also providing a clean blog design for those who prefer to grow their website organically over time. If you'd like to see the theme in action visit our [Triangle Ghost Theme Demo](https://demo.haeckdesign.com/triangle/). If you're looking to personalize your site we'd recommend starting with the [UIKit Documentation](https://www.getuikit.com), since that is the JS & CSS used with this theme.
